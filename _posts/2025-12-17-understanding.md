"The vain presumption of understanding everything can have no
other basis than never having understood anything.  For anyone
who had ever experienced just once the perfect understanding 
of one single thing, and had truly tasted how knowledge is 
accomplished, would recognize that of the infinity of other 
truths he understands nothing."
                                                    -Galileo

"Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them."
                                                    -Von Neumann
